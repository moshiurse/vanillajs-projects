If you are on the border between sizes, a smaller size will have stronger targeted compression than a larger size.

        "answer": `<p>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4ZzuvzPIXk">here</a>&nbsp;to watch our&nbsp;instructional&nbsp;video or read on below for written&nbsp;instructions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Things to remember the first time you put your K1s on:</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>The K1&nbsp;Is Tight!</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr">Sit down and inch them up like a wetsuit. Over time, they will conform to your body.&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">It could take 5 minutes or more to put the K1&nbsp;on for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Tug on Those Tights!&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr">Pull firmly on the high-strength cables that run through the K1&nbsp;to work them up your legs.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>The K1&nbsp;Is Packed With Tech!</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr">There will be exposed cables at the ankles but they’re meant to be there.&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr"><br>
        &nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Putting on</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr">1. Pull the dials out to disengage the support. You should be able to twist them freely in both directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">2. From inside the waistband, stretch outward to relax the Embrace System™. Pull firmly, you should feel the cables move.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">3. Sitting down, pull the K1&nbsp;over each foot. Position the cuffs at your ankles with the seam on the inside of your legs.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">4. Work the K1&nbsp;up to your knees. Position the criss-cross pattern at your mid-shins - it’s ok to pull the cables firmly.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">5. Continue working the K1&nbsp;up to your mid-thighs. Align the two light grey bars with the bend of your knee.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">6. Stand up and pull the waistband over your hips. This will be difficult if the light grey bars aren’t positioned correctly.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Adjusting</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">1. Push the dials in and rotate to engage support - you will feel hip pressure. The left dial controls the left leg, and right controls right.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">2. Stretch the waistband outward and move (squat, jog, etc.) to distribute support down your legs.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">3. The K1&nbsp;provides more support the tighter the cables are. Your support is personal - adjust according to comfort or medical recommendation.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr">4. You will know your K1&nbsp;is&nbsp;working as you feel it tighten across your waist, thighs, and calves.&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Removal</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr">1. Disengage the support by pulling the control dials out. Pull the waistband outwards to release the cables. Work the K1&nbsp;down your legs and over your feet.</p>`,

        "qeustion": "How do I know it's working?",
        "answer": "You will know the K1 is working by the pressure you feel from the cables, and the support you feel when pushing into them at your knees. The K1 tightens from the waist down and, as a result, you will first feel the pressure at your hips - this is the first sign that it is working! As you begin to move, the support will distribute down your legs. To test it at your knees, plant your foot and gently push your knee inward - towards your midline. You should feel the cables around the knee tighten to resist the joint moving in this undesireable way. Continue to rotate the dials to your desired comfort and support level.",
